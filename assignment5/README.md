> Create a narrative using the mechanic of CSS parallax scrolling. Using the [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/charliekoepke/HTML5Boilerplate) as a template. The topic/story is up to you, but create something that you'd like to share with the world. [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/provision/#/provision) will also be added to the page to see how much traffic it produces.
