        <h2>What is the <cite>Harvest Moon</cite> series?</h2>
        <p>
          <cite>Harvest Moon</cite> is a roleplaying farming simulator that originated in Japan. Under the name "Ushi no 
          Tane", the game usually starts off with the player inheriting a farm, which they then must develop and grow. 
          The series was released in the U.S. and Europe under the name "Harvest Moon", but in recent years had to switch 
          to the name "Story of Seasons", due to Natsume owning the rights to the name. There still exist <cite>Harvest Moon</cite> 
          games under that name, but they are not created and directed by the same people who created the original games. 
          The original creators of the game split off from Natsume and now develop their own series.
