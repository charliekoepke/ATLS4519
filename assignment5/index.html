        <h2>What is the <cite>Harvest Moon</cite> series?</h2>
        <p>
          <cite>Harvest Moon</cite> is a roleplaying farming simulator that originated in Japan. Under the name "Ushi no 
          Tane", the game usually starts off with the player inheriting a farm, which they then must develop and grow. 
          The series was released in the U.S. and Europe under the name "Harvest Moon", but in recent years had to switch 
          to the name "Story of Seasons", due to Natsume owning the rights to the name. There still exist <cite>Harvest Moon</cite> 
          games under that name, but they are not created and directed by the same people who created the original games. 
          The original creators of the game split off from Natsume and now develop their own series.

        <h2>Common Gameplay Elements</h2>
        <p>
          The game usually starts off with the player inheriting a farm. In <cite>Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town</cite>, 
          the farm was inherited from the player's grandfather. The player will then get a basic tutorial of how to farm, such 
          as hoeing, planting, and watering crops. If the player acquires animals, the tutorial for how to care for those animals 
          will then be shown to the player. The easy crop that a player usually starts out growing is a turnip, as it doesn't take 
          too long to grow and it shows the player how to grow a crop relatively easily. Players not only have the option to farm 
          and ranch, they can also forage and fish in the surrounding wilderness in order to make a profit. There have also been 
          more customisation options added to many of the newer games, including customising your character, your farm, and sometimes 
          even a whole town's layout! Each game usually has a new town with new characters, and sometimes they even feature characters 
          from older games as fun little easter eggs for long-time players.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the years of <cite>Harvest Moon</cite> games, there were also romance options added. Since the first few games in 
          the series, the player could only choose a male character, the marriage candidates were all girls. Starting after the 
          release of <cite>Friends of Mineral Town</cite>, a completely separate version with a girl character was released. The 
          two games had to be separate since the game code, at the time, didn't have the capacity to have the player choose between 
          the two options at the beginning of the game. The release of the DS games gave the player the ability to choose their 
          gender at the start of the game. In order to marry a character, the player would have to raise their heart level, such 
          as with gifts or talking to the character, and also experience all of their marriage events. These events would trigger 
          if the conditions were met, such as the weather, the heart level, and the location. If all the conditions were met, then 
          the player could gift the candidate a blue feather, and ask them to marry them. In later games, there were also other 
          special items, such as a ring, that would first have to be given to the candidate in order to establish dating before 
          a marriage proposal could happen.
        </p>
        <div class="parallax sos-marriage-candidates"></div>
        <p>
          The <cite>Harvest Moon</cite> games also included "marriage rivals". These were more prominent in the older games, 
          such as <cite>Friends of Mineral Town</cite>, <cite>Animal Parade</cite>, and <cite>Tree of Tranquility</cite>. The 
          love rivals were characters that could potentially "steal" the marriage candidates from the player. The process of this 
          happening was the same as marriage candidate events. The events would be triggered by the player, and 
          it would make the heart level go up between the marriage candidate and the rival. If the heart level went up enough, 
          then that marriage candidate and rival would get together and the marriage candidate could no longer be won over by the 
          player.

        <h2>Influence</h2>
        <p>
          One of the biggest influences that Harvest Moon has had was on the game <cite>Stardew Valley</cite>. Eric Barone, the creator of 
          <cite>Stardew Valley</cite> said himself that Harvest Moon was a very big influence. With the popularity of <cite>Stardew Valley</cite> and many 
          more <cite>Harvest Moon</cite> games being released, there has also been a growing popularity of similar farming simulator games. 
          Many of the games center around a different plot than <cite>Harvest Moon</cite>, but they have a lot of the same characteristics and 
          gameplay mechanics. For exmaple, the game <cite>My Time at Portia</cite>, took some influence from <cite>Harvest Moon</cite> 
          and <cite>Stardew Valley</cite>, but it also added more game mechanics and crafting mechanics that made it stand out from 
          the other farming simulator games. There are also a number of indie video game projects that use <cite>Harvest Moon</cite> 
          as a template for their game; improving on the areas that <cite>Harvest Moon</cite> lacked, and keeping and upgrading the 
          game mechanics that people loved.
