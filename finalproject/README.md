# Creative Project

> Choose a Node.js framework and npm package to learn about, and build a creative project that demonstrates the technologies usage and potential. Make it academic, artistic, and creative! Include a comprehensive "How To" as well, so other people can use and learn.

The Node.js I decided to use is [koa.js](https://koajs.com/). They have all of their functions and how to use them included on their website, so my project aimed to illustrate those functions in a more artistic and creative way.
