                        The desert rain frog is a species of frog that's part of the Brevicipitidae family.
                        Found native to South Africa, despite their name "rain frog" their natural habitats are 
                        usually sandy shores close to sand dunes.

                        The desert rain frog is a nocturnal animal, so they usually spend the daytime inside a small 
                        burrow in the sand. They feed primarily on moths, beetles, and insect larvae. Unlike other frogs, 
                        when rain frogs are threatened, they make a high pitched squeaking sound rather than a typical 
                        "ribbit" sound. Rain frogs are currently close to  being threatened due to mining and the 
                        increased amounts of human settlements.

                        Videos of the desert rain frog have been shown on BBC One and BBC Earth's YouTube channel.
                        The videos gain many views in part due to the fact that the frog is very round and super cute.
                        In fact, one of the vidos of the desert rain frog is rightly named "A tiny angry squeaking frog | 
                        Super Cute Animals BBC".
