                        The desert rain frog is a species of frog that's part of the Brevicipitidae family.
                        Found native to South Africa, despite their name "rain frog" their natural habitats are 
                        usually sandy shores close to sand dunes.

                        The desert rain frog is a nocturnal animal, so they usually spend the daytime inside a small 
                        burrow in the sand. They feed primarily on moths, beetles, and insect larvae. Unlike other frogs, 
                        when rain frogs are threatened, they make a high pitched squeaking sound rather than a typical 
                        "ribbit" sound. Rain frogs are currently close to  being threatened due to mining and the 
                        increased amounts of human settlements.

                        Videos of the desert rain frog have been shown on BBC One and BBC Earth's YouTube channel.
                        The videos gain many views in part due to the fact that the frog is very round and super cute.
                        In fact, one of the vidos of the desert rain frog is rightly named "A tiny angry squeaking frog | 
                        Super Cute Animals BBC".

                        Desert rain frogs are small, plump, and round. They are described to have bulging eyes, 
                        and they resemble squeaky dog toys, which they also sound like. It has transparent skin on its 
                        stomach, so that its internal organ can be seen by looking at it. Because their bodies are so 
                        round and its legs are so small, desert rain frogs cannot hop like other frog species do.
                        Instead, they walk across the sand in their natural habitat.

                Uncommon for a frog species, desert rain frogs do not have a tadpole stage during their development. 
                They develop directly from an egg into their adult stage without the usual in between. 
                Desert rain frogs lay their eggs directly in their burrows, which they usually stay in during the day.
