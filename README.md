# ATLS 4519 - Creative Web Development

All labs and projects for ATLS 4519 - Creative Web Development

> Creative Development Tools is part of the WEB focus in the Technology Arts Media (TAM) program.
> Students will learn to design and develop creative websites and advance their understanding of the primary frontend web languages HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.
> The course will utilise higher-level development tools and open source frameworks to achieve a modern work-flow.
> The class is an experimental sandbox that will play with (and inevitably break) bleeding-edge web technologies with subversion and vigour!
> Mistakes will happen and are most welcome â€“ problem solving and learning are encouraged.

> Use css animation, css patterns, css shapes, and creative google fonts and icons.
> For this project you will use git to make at least 100 git commits and "many" pushes to github.
