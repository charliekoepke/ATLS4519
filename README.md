# ATLS 4519 - Creative Web Development

All labs and projects for ATLS 4519 - Creative Web Development

> Creative Development Tools is part of the WEB focus in the Technology Arts Media (TAM) program. Students will learn to design and develop creative websites and advance their understanding of the primary frontend web languages HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. The course will utilise higher-level development tools and open source frameworks to achieve a modern work-flow. The class is an experimental sandbox that will play with (and inevitably break) bleeding-edge web technologies with subversion and vigour! Mistakes will happen and are most welcome â€“ problem solving and learning are encouraged.

## [Assignment 1 - Zsh/Bash Me](https://creative.colorado.edu/~chko6454/atls4519/assignment1/zsh-bash-me.html)

> Create and publish a one page html document using ONLY the terminal (no GUI). Use Zsh or Bash to create a local dev directory, cd into dev and create img, css, and js directories and 2 html documents, index.html and zsh-bash-me.html. Code the html markup in the terminal only using NANO. Connect to the creative server using the terminal (no GUI ftp clients) create a dev directory inside your main public_html directory and upload your zsh-bash-me.html page to the dev directory.

## [Assignment 2 - Commitment](https://creative.colorado.edu/~chko6454/atls4519/assignment2/)

> Create a subdirectory "commitment" inside your dev directory. Commitment can be defined as a quality of being dedicated to an action - for this project you will use a stream-of-consciousness approach (a person's thoughts and conscious reactions to events, perceived as a continuous flow) to create a web page tapestry that incorporates text and css design elements. Pick a theme or topic and start riffing. Use css animation, css patterns, css shapes, and creative google fonts and icons. For this project you will use git to make at least 100 git commits and "many" pushes to github.

## [Assignment 3 - Exquisite Corpse](https://creative.colorado.edu/~chko6454/atls4519/assignment3/)

> A method invented by surrealists by which a collection of words or images is collectively assembled. Each collaborator adds a composition in sequence. For this project, construct a creative narrative where each team member contributes a paragraph based on what the previous person contributed.

## [Assignment 4 - HTML5 Boilerplate](https://creative.colorado.edu/~chko6454/atls4519/assignment4/)

> Create a custom starting template that combines HTML5 boilerplate with a webpack dart-sass setup. Modify to create your own custom starter elements. Version with Git and create a repository on GitHub. Continue to develop this and push to GitHub with new updates.

## [Assignment 5 - Parallax Narrative](https://creative.colorado.edu/~chko6454/atls4519/assignment5/)

> Create a narrative using the mechanic of CSS parallax scrolling. Using the [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/charliekoepke/HTML5Boilerplate) as a template. The topic/story is up to you, but create something that you'd like to share with the world. [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/provision/#/provision) will also be added to the page to see how much traffic it produces.

## [Final Project - Creative Project](https://creative.colorado.edu/~chko6454/atls4519/finalproject/)

> Choose a Node.js framework and npm package to learn about, and build a creative project that demonstrates the technologies usage and potential. Make it academic, artistic, and creative! Include a comprehensive "How To" as well, so other people can use and learn.
