# ATLS 4519 - Creative Web Development

All labs and projects for ATLS 4519 - Creative Web Development

> Creative Development Tools is part of the WEB focus in the Technology Arts Media (TAM) program. Students will learn to design and develop creative websites and advance their understanding of the primary frontend web languages HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. The course will utilise higher-level development tools and open source frameworks to achieve a modern work-flow. The class is an experimental sandbox that will play with (and inevitably break) bleeding-edge web technologies with subversion and vigour! Mistakes will happen and are most welcome â€“ problem solving and learning are encouraged.

## [Assignment 2 - Commitment](https://creative.colorado.edu/~chko6454/atls4519/assignment2/)

> Create a subdirectory "commitment" inside your dev directory. Commitment can be defined as a quality of being dedicated to an action - for this project you will use a stream-of-consciousness approach (a person's thoughts and conscious reactions to events, perceived as a continuous flow) to create a web page tapestry that incorporates text and css design elements. Pick a theme or topic and start riffing. Use css animation, css patterns, css shapes, and creative google fonts and icons. For this project you will use git to make at least 100 git commits and "many" pushes to github.
