		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>
		Hello, my name is Charlie Koepke. I'm a third-year CTD major with a Computer Science minor. I changed my major halfway through college, so this is my first full year as a CTD major.
		Something interesting about me is that I play four instruments: guitar, piano, violin, and ukulele. I am also on a CU Boulder street dance team called VeRVE Collisionz. We host
		dance concerts and competitions!
		</p>

		I'm interested in having web development and design be the focus of my major. I've taken the Web class through ATLAS last Spring semester, and it was a lot of fun. I know HTML pretty
		well, and if I don't know something I can usually find the answer to my problem on the Internet. I'm hoping in this class that I can learn more about web devlopment and design
		and just get more experience with it, since it's what I want to do with my career.
